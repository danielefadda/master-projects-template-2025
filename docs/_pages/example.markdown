This is an introductory text for the SoBigData Big Data Project Template. Here you can provide a brief overview of the project, its goals, and what participants can expect from this final laboratory. The text should be engaging and informative, setting the stage for the content that follows. 
This text can be used to highlight the significance of the project, the methodologies employed, and the expected outcomes. But it could also be used to introduce the story of the project, the motivations behind it, or to anticipate the best discoveries made during the research. There isn't a single way to write this text, but it should be concise and to the point, capturing the essence of the project in a few sentences. Use what you learned in the Data Storytelling course to make it engaging and compelling.

# Introduction to the Project

You can use headings, paragraphs, and lists to structure the content effectively. This can be done using Markdown syntax, which allows for easy formatting of text. For example, you can use **bold** or *italic* text to emphasize key points, and you can create lists to organize information clearly.

This is an example of how to format the text in a way that is visually appealing and easy to read.
In this paragraph we use a `.lead` class to highlight the main points of the project.

    You can complete the entire page using only markdown syntax, but you can also use HTML tags to add more complex elements. In this example, we use a paragraph with a class of "green" to highlight the text in green color.

            <h3>AIM OF THE SCHOOL</h3>
                <p>
                The Summer School aims to equip <strong>researchers, data scientists, and social scientists</strong> with an <strong>interdisciplinary understanding and skill set</strong> to address complex societal challenges. By blending <strong>technical training in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence</strong> with <strong>ethical, political, and social dynamics</strong>, the program empowers the students in facing today's pressing societal challenges with a balanced approach that combines <strong>innovative data methodologies, stakeholder awareness, and a commitment to responsible, transparent practices</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over <strong>four themed days</strong>, participants first explore the <strong>new European research framework</strong>—covering directives, open science principles, and data-sharing policies. Next, they dive into <strong>Information Dynamics</strong>, examining how (dis)information is created, transferred, and transformed. The third focus, <strong>Political Dynamics</strong>, looks at how policy, ideology, institutions, and individuals shape discussions and social discourse. Finally, <strong>Social Dynamics</strong> reveals how communities and institutions influence each other, how societal structures evolve, and how collective behaviors emerge. <strong>Expert-led lectures</strong> throughout the mornings expose participants to state-of-the-art methods and real-world case studies, highlighting best practices and contemporary applications of big data and AI. The <strong>afternoon sessions</strong> are dedicated to <strong>collaborative group projects</strong>, allowing students to actively engage in hands-on learning experiences. At the end of the week, a <strong>panel of experts</strong> in data mining and AI will evaluate the projects. This approach ensures a comprehensive and interactive learning environment allowing the participants to explore the <strong>ethical, legal, and practical dimensions</strong> of leveraging data for societal well-being.
