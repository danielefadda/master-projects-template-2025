This is an introductory text for the SoBigData Big Data Project Template. Here you can provide a brief overview of the
project, its goals, and what participants can expect from this final laboratory. The text should be engaging and
informative, setting the stage for the content that follows.
This text can be used to highlight the significance of the project, the methodologies employed, and the expected
outcomes. But it could also be used to introduce the story of the project, the motivations behind it, or to anticipate
the best discoveries made during the research. There isn't a single way to write this text, but it should be concise and
to the point, capturing the essence of the project in a few sentences. Use what you learned in the Data Storytelling
course to make it engaging and compelling.

# Introduction to the Project

You can use headings, paragraphs, and lists to structure the content effectively. This can be done using Markdown
syntax, which allows for easy formatting of text. For example, you can use **bold** or *italic* text to emphasize key
points, and you can create lists to organize information clearly.

This is an example of how to format the text in a way that is visually appealing and easy to read.
In this paragraph we use a `.lead` class to highlight the main points of the project.

<p class="green"> 
    You can complete the entire page using only markdown syntax, but you can also use HTML tags to add more complex elements. In this example, we use a paragraph with a class of "green" to highlight the text in green color.
</p>

<p class="mt-3"><strong>The structure of the work is organised around key thematic areas:</strong></p>

<p>
The project framework is designed to offer an <strong>interdisciplinary approach</strong>, combining technical methodologies such as <strong>data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence</strong> with broader considerations. The content is structured to alternate between <strong>theoretical guidance</strong> and <strong>practical exploration</strong>, encouraging users to apply concepts through hands-on development of a data-driven application or story.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Throughout the development, you will engage with <strong>real-world datasets</strong>, explore <strong>data-driven narratives</strong>, and reflect on the <strong>ethical and social implications</strong> of your choices. The structure is designed to be modular, allowing flexibility while maintaining a coherent narrative flow.

# How we support our ideas?

Using data visualizations is a powerful way to support your ideas and findings. In this template, you can easily
integrate visualizations created with Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar for interactive graphics.
