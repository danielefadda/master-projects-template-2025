To develop the website  we will use a Static Site Generator (SSG), which allows you to create fast-loading websites without the need for complex backend systems or databases.
In particular, we will use one of the most popular SSGs: **Jekyll** and GitHub Pages.

# What you need to start

To start, you need to have:
- A GitHub account.
- A well-structured draft of your project, also a Word document or something similar is fine.
- All charts exported in json format, which you can create using Altair.
- A folder with all the images you want to use in your website.

# How to start

The development of the website can be done in two ways:
1. Completely online, using GitHub and GitHub Pages.
2. Locally, using Jekyll and then pushing the changes to GitHub.

In the guide, we will focus on the first option, which is the easiest way to create a website. 
However, if you want to develop the website locally, you need to install Jekyll on your computer. 
You can find the instructions on how to do it [in the official guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) or in the [local development section]({{ site.baseurl }}/local-development/).
