To develop the *Progettone* website  we will use a **Static Site Generator** (SSG), which allows you to create fast-loading websites without the need for complex backend systems or databases.
In particular, we will use one of the most popular SSGs: Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

**Jekyll** is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator that takes your content, renders it into a static website, and serves it. Combined with GitHub Pages, it allows you to host your website for free, making it an ideal choice for personal projects, portfolios, and documentation sites.

**GitHub Pages** is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It supports Jekyll out of the box, making it easy to deploy your Jekyll site with just a few clicks.

# What you need to start

- [ ] üêô **A GitHub account** - If you don't have one, you can [create it for free](https://github.com/)
- [ ] üìù **A well-structured draft of your project** - This can be a Word document or any other format you prefer. It should include the main ideas, structure, and content you want to present on your website.
- [ ] üìä **A folder with your saved Charts** - You can use the charts you created saving them as .json files in the `assets/charts` folder.
- [ ] üìÇ **A folder with all the images** you want to use on your website: you can save them in the `assets/images` folder.

# How to start

The development of the website can be done in two ways:
1. **Completely online, using GitHub and GitHub Pages.**
2. Locally, using Jekyll and then pushing the changes to GitHub.

In the guide, we will focus on the first option, which is the easiest way to create a website. 
However, if you want to develop the website locally, you need to install Jekyll on your computer. 
You can find the instructions on how to do it [in the official guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) or in the [local development section]({{ site.baseurl }}/local-development/).
